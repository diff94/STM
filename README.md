Incorporating structural topic modeling into short text analysis


# Introduction
The past few decades have seen the rapid development of topic modeling.
So far, research has been more concerned with determining the ideal
number of topics or meaningful topic clustering words than with applying
topic modeling techniques to evaluate linguistic theories. This study
proposes the Structural Topic Model (STM)-led framework to facilitate the
interpretation of topic modeling results and standardize text analysis. STM
encompasses various model training mechanisms, thereby requiring
systematic designs to properly combine language studies. “Structural” in
STM refers to the inclusion of metadata structure. Unlike the corpus-based
keyness approach, STM can capture contextual cues and meta-information
for the interpretation of topical results. Besides, STM can make crosscorpora
comparisons via topical contrast, a challenging task for corpusdriven
related models such as the Biterm Topic Model (BTM). Stylistic
variations in song lyrics are taken as an illustration to show how to use the
suggested framework to delve into the linguistic theory proposed by
Pennebaker (2013). The topical model and iterable model in the proposed
paradigm can clarify how pronouns affect style distinction. We believe the
proposed STM-led framework can shed light on text analysis by conducting
a reproducible cross-corpora comparison on short texts.
